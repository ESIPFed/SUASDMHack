# SUASDMHack
<h1>Repository for 2017 Science sUAS Data Management Hackathon</h1>

**Call for participation!**

Do you like robots? Do you like flying robots? Do you like open earth science data? Do you like flying robots that collect earth science data to help solve important global challenges?
 
Then please join us in Bloomington, IN for a 1 day drone data Workshop & Hackathon on July 24, 2017 co-located with the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) summer meeting. The morning workshop includes short presentations by earth and information scientists from NASA, USGS, DJI, USDA, OGC and others involved in the area of science drones (AKA small unmanned aerial systems AKA sUAS AKA flying data robots). After lunch, speakers and participants will come together for a hackathon, working on projects ranging from prototyping data formating tools, through brainstorming best practices for data management, workflow design, or [your idea here].
 
Attendance is FREE (though please sign up by June 30th, 2017 at the link below) and food will be provided! 
 
We are particularly hoping that researchers - including graduate students - with interest or expertise in drone use and/or data management will participate!
